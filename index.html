  Kritika, you are beautiful in ways that words often fail to describe.
  It’s not just about how pretty you look — it’s the kindness in your heart,
  the warmth in your voice, and the way you somehow make everything feel lighter.
  You have this rare kind of beauty that shows when you talk, when you laugh,
  and even when you’re just being your silly, talkative self.

  <br><br>

  You are incredibly important to me, more than you’ll ever realize.
  No matter how far you are, you’ve always stayed close to my heart.
  Through good days and bad ones, through silence and endless talks,
  you’ve been my comfort, my safe place, and my favorite person.
  These last two years wouldn’t have been the same without you.

  This little website is made with so much love by me —
  <strong>Shrishti</strong> — just to remind you that you matter,
  that you are loved deeply, and that no distance can ever change
  how special you are to me. Always. 💖
